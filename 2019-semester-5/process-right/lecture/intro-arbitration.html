No agreement=no arbitration. &mdash;&gt; waves your right to go to &ldquo;regular&rdquo; court. (both parties can however agree to take the dispute to court, but this rarley happens)</p><p><em>Flexible</em> - very little rules. The parties rule every aspect for ex. the arbitrators, applicable law, procedual law etc. The seat is chosen for the applicable law (Seat: Stockholm, Law: swedish arbitration act)</p><p>Limits: due process. - parties are treated equally, reasonable opportunity to present their case. (state regulated)</p><p>Private,(and confidential). Close-door proceedings. Confidentiality is not absolute, but depends on the institutional rules, local law etc.</p><p>Can be <em>time and cost efficient</em> - depends on the parties who can set their own DL.</p><p>The state court can assist and supervise - usually there is no need for this.</p><p><strong>The award is final and binding.</strong></p><p>Different from mediation (=agreement), and closer to a court ruling.</p><p>Whatever the tribunal decides is final and cannot be challenges (but see limits under)</p><h3 id="types">Types</h3><ol><li><p>National/domestic vs. International</p><ul><li>international = the dispute regards an international element (not necessarily that the parties are from different states) Check if the country is a Model country (UNICITRAL)</li></ul></li><li><p>Investment vs. Commercial - Between states</p><ul><li>investment = always between state and an investor</li><li>commercial = not the state in its soverign role</li></ul></li><li><p>Institutional vs. Ad hoc</p><ul><li>SCC, ICC = institution that takes care of the secreteriat (ex. sends papers, checks awards for mistakes, help the parties in dead-lock situations)</li><li>Ad Hoc = no institutions, no institutional rules.
