Law School Notes in Pollen

If you got lost in this repo then I welcome you to my note-taking from law school at Stockholm University. 
They are taken using pollen and racket, and I am not accountable for the information correctness. 
The notes are in Swedish and regard swedish law as taught in 2017-2022. 

Please do not use the notes as primary source.
